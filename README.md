# 🏨 Hospitality Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data of **AtliQ Hotels** to uncover key business insights.  
Using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**, I performed **data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on **134k+ booking records** to identify trends, occupancy rates, revenue performance, and customer behavior.

## 📂 Datasets Used
- `fact_bookings.csv` – booking details (guests, dates, status, revenue, etc.)
- `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv` – room capacity & occupancy  
- `dim_hotels.csv` – hotel information (name, city, category)  
- `dim_rooms.csv` – room categories and classes  
- `dim_date.csv` – date dimension for time-based analysis

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Removed invalid entries (e.g., negative guest counts).
- Handled missing values (e.g., occupancy capacity).
